# 🎯 APK BUILD STATUS & NEXT STEPS

## 🚀 Current Status: APK Build In Progress

Your Skana Mobile App is currently being built by EAS (Expo Application Services). Here's what's happening and what to do next:

### ✅ What We've Done:
1. **✅ Logged into Expo** as user `stephen3000`
2. **✅ Started APK build** using EAS build system
3. **✅ Created website download page** (`website-download-page.html`)
4. **✅ Configured build for APK distribution**

### 🔍 Check Build Status:

#### Method 1: EAS Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: **https://expo.dev/accounts/stephen3000/projects**
2. Look for your **"skana-mobile"** project
3. Click on **"Builds"** tab
4. You'll see the build progress and status

#### Method 2: Command Line
```bash
# Run this to check build status
eas build:list --platform android --limit 5
```

### ⏱️ Expected Timeline:
- **Build Time**: 5-15 minutes typically
- **Status Updates**: Real-time on EAS dashboard
- **Completion**: You'll get download link when ready

### 📱 When Build Completes:

#### Step 1: Download APK
1. Go to EAS dashboard builds page
2. Find your completed build (green checkmark)
3. Click **"Download"** button
4. Save the APK file to your computer

#### Step 2: Rename & Prepare
```bash
# Rename the downloaded file to something user-friendly
mv [downloaded-file].apk skana-mobile-v1.0.0.apk
```

#### Step 3: Upload to Website
1. Upload `skana-mobile-v1.0.0.apk` to your website's downloads folder
2. Use the provided HTML file: `website-download-page.html`
3. Update the download link in HTML to match your server path

#### Step 4: Test Installation
1. Download APK from your website
2. Install on Android device to test
3. Verify all app features work correctly

### 🌐 Website Integration:

I've created a complete download page (`website-download-page.html`) with:
- **Professional design** with app features showcase
- **Clear installation instructions** for users
- **Security notice** to build trust
- **Mobile-responsive** layout
- **Support contact** information

### 📋 Quick Commands Reference:

```bash
# Check build status
eas build:list --platform android

# If you need to build again
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# View project details
npx expo whoami
```

### 🚨 If Build Fails:

1. **Check EAS dashboard** for error details
2. **Common issues**:
   - Missing project ID (run `eas init` again)
   - Build timeout (retry the build)
   - Invalid configuration (check eas.json)

3. **Rebuild command**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile preview --clear-cache
   ```

### 📞 Next Actions:

1. **Monitor build progress** on EAS dashboard
2. **Download APK** when build completes (5-15 minutes)
3. **Test the APK** on Android device
4. **Upload to website** with provided HTML page
5. **Share download link** with your users

### 🎉 You're Almost Done!
