# Aurora Frontend State Machine - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETE

The Aurora guided walkthrough now implements **progressive disclosure** via a state machine that mirrors the backend's session status.

---

## What This Means

Instead of showing:
```
❌ Narration + Question + Checkpoint + Suggestions all at once
```

Now it shows:
```
✅ Narration → (when appropriate) Question → (when appropriate) Checkpoint → (when appropriate) Suggestions
```

Each element appears **exactly when it's needed** in the learning flow.

---

## Implementation Summary

### Core Logic
Added `auroraDisplayState` useMemo in **StudySessionScreen.tsx** that:
1. Reads `aiSessionSnapshot.status` from backend
2. Reads `aiTurn` content (narration, comprehension_check, checkpoint, etc.)
3. Computes visibility flags for each UI element
4. Passes only relevant props to AuroraGuide

### Backend Status Values
- **`active`**: Learning in progress → Show narration + conditionally question/checkpoint/suggestions
- **`awaiting_checkpoint`**: Waiting for checkpoint submission → Show only checkpoint (hide suggestions)
- **`completed`**: Session finished → Hide all Aurora elements
- **`abandoned`/`error`**: Edge cases → Hide all Aurora elements

### Display Logic
```typescript
if (status === 'active') {
    showNarration = true
    showQuestion = aiTurn.comprehension_check ? true : false
    showCheckpoint = (aiTurn.checkpoint && !hasQuestion) ? true : false
    showSuggestions = (!hasQuestion && !hasCheckpoint) ? true : false
}

if (status === 'awaiting_checkpoint') {
    showCheckpoint = true
    showSuggestions = false
    // etc.
}
```

## Files Modified

- **src/screens/course/StudySessionScreen.tsx**
  - Added `auroraDisplayState` computed state (useMemo)
  - Updated `<AuroraGuide />` render call to use conditional props

- **Other files**: No changes needed (AuroraGuide already had conditional rendering)

---

## TypeScript Validation

✅ **Compilation succeeds** - No type errors

---

## User Experience

### Scenario: Reading + Question + Checkpoint

1. **Aurora explains content**
   ```
   Display: Narration + Suggestion buttons
   Rationale: Let learner read and digest
   ```

2. **Aurora asks comprehension check**
   ```
   Display: Narration + Question
   Hidden: Suggestions (they confuse the question)
   ```

3. **Learner answers**
   ```
   Backend decides: "Show checkpoint now"
   Display: Narration + Checkpoint card
   Hidden: Question, Suggestions
   ```

4. **Learner submits checkpoint work**
   ```
   Status changes: active → awaiting_checkpoint
   Display: Checkpoint card with submission status
   Hidden: Everything else
   ```

5. **Backend analyzes & continues**
   ```
   Status changes: awaiting_checkpoint → active
   Display: New segment's narration
   Repeats flow based on new content...
   ```

## How to Test

1. **Start Aurora mode** on any lesson/block
2. **Observe progression**: Does content appear step-by-step?
3. **Answer questions**: Do suggestions disappear when question appears?
4. **Submit checkpoint**: Do all suggestions/questions hide?
5. **Check status change**: Does "Waiting for review" message show?

## Key Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Progressive Disclosure | Learner not overwhelmed by too much at once |
| Backend-Driven | Frontend respects what backend says to show |
| Clear Sequencing | Question → Checkpoint flow is obvious |
| Proper States | Checkpoint submission properly gates next content |
| Better UX | Content appears exactly when needed |
